## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- (I attempted to re-create the challenge as best as I could with my current knowledge of HTML and CSS)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Super new to coding and just learning the basics. I struggled with placement and display:grid and flex. I know there is much better ways to complete this challenge so I'm eager to read and see others' solutions so I can learn and update my code.

### Continued development

Continue to learn basic HTML and CSS and start to implement JS into my code.
Keep attempting Frontend Mentor challenges and continue my online education. Thinking of buying Frontend Mentor Pro for ease of knowing the measurements of images etc. for a challenge.
